# Data Types

## Lists

x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Ordered
: When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order,
: and that order will not change.
: If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the
: list.

Changeable
: The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a
: list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
: Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value

## Tuples

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Ordered
: When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined
: order, and that order will not change.

: the tuple has been created.
